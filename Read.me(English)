About this course
Hello everyone~ Welcome to the class of uband python programming class s1.

You can see this paragraph, which proves that you have stepped into the ocean of technology with one toe. github is known as the'world's largest male dating community', oh yes, maybe this is the world's largest straight man Gathering place~ They upload code here, communicate with each other, learn from each other, and never stop.

The first small goal of our course is to teach everyone to use this website. Yes, we don’t start programming. If we want to be good at work, we must first sharpen our tools~ A year ago, I gave a lecture to children in college and let I was surprised that none of them knew there was a magical website called github.

I will record the video of the guide and put it in the course of the official account. I have recorded a Chinese version and an English version (joking). Welcome everyone to correct my spoken language, smash yourself, and serve everyone. I hope we will have it in the next 28 days or more. Time, we study together.

A few requirements
Complete the homework (minimum requirement) If the homework is not completed, it will really make me feel very frustrated. Since you are here~ then I have a responsibility to ensure that you learn. I still keep my principles: 1) Don’t do homework for a week, text messages will pass; 2) If you don’t do homework for two weeks, the system voice call will pass; 3) If you don’t do homework for three weeks, I or your assistant's call will pass; 4) Don’t do it for four weeks Homework, forget it, I gave up~

I can’t say how good I am, but I think I try to analyze myself and show you one thing # Serious～ I hope webprogram# , You tell your own replays to others, record them, and learn to share; you have developed the ability of # Difference# to know what to practice and when to learn; ... programming class, Give you a chance to let yourself go.

the sense of purpose
#, I hope you can think about it, what do you want to do most? Can it be achieved by programming? There are many people who do not have their own works for the whole life, and programming, you will easily realize your own works, please dig more about yourself.
